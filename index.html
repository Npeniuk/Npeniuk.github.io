            <h2>Where to start?</h2>
            <p>Many first-time gardeners will be unsure how to start gardening and will just place a seed into the ground and wonder why their vegetables have not grown.
                I think you should follow my step by step guide on how to grow potatoes for begginers, I go over all of the nessasarey materials and instructions on 
                how to start growing your own potatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why potatoes as seen in the what to grow guide, I list out some easy to grow vegetables and herbs for beginners.
                Potatoes are a very easy to grow plant that are a staple food in peoples diets. Potatoes have a high yield, they are one of the most productive crops per square foot.

                They can be grown in grow bags making it easier to harvest, as you can dump the contents of the bag on the ground and find all the spuds. Another reason to grow them is
                 their versatility in the kitchen roast, mash, fry, bake, soup, salad, etc. They also have a long storage life lasting months if stored correctly, unused potatoes can be turned 
                 into seeds for next season.
